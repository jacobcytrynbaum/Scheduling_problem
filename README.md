A test scheduling problem. This object reads in a file with student class information, builds a graph of classes, and greedily makes a exam schedule. There is a method to create a vector of exam slots which calls on a method to create each tree in the vector, which calls on a method to determine adjacency. This further can print the overall exam schedule and each studentâ€™s individual schedule. 

This program relies on Structure5 by Duane Bailey, a package in Java that implements Vectors, sorted Vectors, Binary Search Trees, and other similar data structures. It also incorporates the Java.util package.
